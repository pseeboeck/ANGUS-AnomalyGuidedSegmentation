 The zip-file "publicDatasetRETOUCHtest_spectralis_predictionMaps.zip" contains a separate folder for each model and target, each containing all corresponding prediction-maps for the test-set "TestSpectralis". 

 Each B-Scan is stored as separate .png file, with the naming convention "[VolumeID]_[BscanIndex].png"
 
 The maps are binary:
  - 0 = Background/Normal
  - 1 = Anomalous Area
  - 2 = Lesion Target (IRC, SRF or PED)
